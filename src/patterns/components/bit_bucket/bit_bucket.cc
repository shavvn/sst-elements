// This is a simple component that we use to simulate a disk or NVRAM
// used in a streaming mode. It basically pretends to have a pipe of
// a given bandwidth to which it streams write data. After a block of
// "data" has been written, and ACK is sent back. For reads, it enques
// the read request and sends the data when it has been able to pull the
// data out of the pipe. This is delayed by previous reads and limited
// by the read bandwidth.
//
// The read and write pipes are completly independent. We assume writers
// wait for ACK to come back before data is read, but there is no
// mechanism to veryfy this for independent readers. In fact, since no
// actual data is written or read, a read that in a real application is
// dependent on a write, can happen here without problems.
