- Provide alternative for MPI_IN_PLACE
- Option to skip actual computation (wait only)
    - Omit allocation of unused inside memory in that case
- Should loop count be dependent on area or blocks size that each rank has to compute?
    + It seems more realistic to do that
- Hand calculate number of instructions and messages to verify program
- Add check-pointing
- Right now all ghost cells are in consecutive memory regions
    - Is this realistic?
    - How would they be exchanged, if they were not consecutive?

DONE - Determine some reasonable defaults
DONE - Random fluctuations of compute time; e.g., +- 5%
DONE - Should bytes_sent be something other than size_t?
DONE - Do an allreduce once in a while
DONE - Break into smaller files
DONE - Add a 3-D case. Done already?
DONE - Fix 3-D case
DONE - Add timing
DONE - Fix this: mpiexec -n 3 ghost -t 10 -v -v -x 200 -y 200 -z 0
