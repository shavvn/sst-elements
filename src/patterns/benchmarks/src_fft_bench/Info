Nsamples is the number of problem sizes you want to run. Nstep is the magnitude
(in powers of 2) of the multiplicative step of the series of problem sizes you
want to run.
The initial problem size is specified with the -f flag.

Example: ./program -f 256
with Nsamples=4, Nstep=2

Then, 4 (Nsamples) FFTs will be executed with following sizes:

256
256 * 2^Nstep = 1024
1024 * 2^Nstep = 4096
4096 * 2^Nstep = 8192
