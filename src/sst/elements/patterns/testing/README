These are just some small developer tests for algorithms and functions used in
the pattern generator files. They are meant to try out things, not as regression
or test for the pattern generator components themselves.

Enough time spent to keep the code, but not important enough to fully integrate
into a test structure.


USAGE:
    mpic++ -I.. -Wall ctopo_test.cc -o ctopo_test ../collective_topology.cc
    Run on any number of nodes:
    mpiexec -n 41 ctopo_test
    Prints some info for each rank, then runs some test on rank sizes 1..1024
